"We'll help you make smart and informed decisions about your use of medication, all while keeping you safe."

dose.io is a platform that leverages under-utilized data and empowers users to gauge their risk of addiction and drug-related harms. Its aim is to help minimize adverse health outcomes through a web application that connects with users and their communities.

## What did I build it with?
I built this web app using Streamlit, a Python framework for data science/machine learning apps. I honestly really enjoyed using it!

### Extras
I was the developer of this web app, so I made a post on my porfolio documenting my process! If you want a detailed look into the project, feel free to take a look.
